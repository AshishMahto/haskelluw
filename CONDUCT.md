# Haskell UW Meetup/Group Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

We are dedicated to providing an inclusive and harassment-free experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, education, occupation, income, or socioeconomic status. We welcome participation and do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group at the discretion of the organizers. Our anti-harassment policy can be found at [github.com/zhiyanfoo/haskell-uw/blob/master/CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/zhiyanfoo/haskell-uw/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).

## Anti-harassment Policy

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination -- gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, age, religion, education, occupation, income, or socioeconomic status -- as well as sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the group. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact organizers immediately.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and social events. We value your attendance.

## Organizer Policy

### Warnings

Any organizer can issue a verbal warning to a participant that their behavior violates the anti-harassment policy. Warnings should be reported to event organizers as soon as practical. The report should include:

* Identifying information (name) of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

### Presentations

Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or minor problems, although an organizer should speak to the presenter afterward. However, organizers should take immediate action to politely and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry, this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with further explanation to follow in a less public manner as appropriate.

### Taking Reports

When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant. Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not involved with the situation or non-staff members.

The report should include:

* Identifying information (name) of the participant
* The time you issued the warning
* The behavior that was in violation
* The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of warning)
* The circumstances surrounding the incident
* Your identity
* Other people involved in the incident

### Expulsion

A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:

* A third offense resulting in a warning from other participants
* Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
* A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
* Any harassment including physical contact (e.g., punching or groping someone)
* Any intentional (including non-physical) offense, i.e., taking compromising photos
* Organizers and local authorities should be contacted when appropriate.

### Public Statements

As a general rule, organizers should not make any public statements about the behavior of individual people during or after the event.

In general, consult with other organizers when possible but act when necessary.
